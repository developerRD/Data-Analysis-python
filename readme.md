Hello, I'm Rana Demirer, a Master's in Business Analytics graduate from the Dominican University of California. I want to showcase the significant projects I completed as part of my Marketing Analytics coursework, using both R and Python programming languages.

The first project focuses on Conjoint Analysis, a valuable marketing research technique. In this project, I used my analytical skills to understand consumer preferences and decision-making processes. Leveraging R and Python, I carried out a thorough analysis to uncover insights that could inform strategic marketing decisions.

The second project is centered on Regression Analysis, a critical tool in marketing analytics. Using R and Python, I analyzed data to model and understand relationships between variables. This project gave me the opportunity to show my knowledge of marketing and skills in quantitative analysis, providing actionable insights for optimizing marketing strategies.

Additionally, I've worked on Python projects focused on visualizing Adidas sales data and other related aspects. These projects highlight my skills in data visualization and manipulation, showing my ability to translate data into actionable information for informed business decisions.

Feel free to explore my GitHub repository to see these projects and get a sense of my capabilities in marketing analytics, data analysis, and data visualization.
