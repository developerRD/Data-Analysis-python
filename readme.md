Hello, I'm Rana Demirer. Master's in Business Analytics graduate from the Dominican University of California. I want to showcase the significant projects I completed as part of my Marketing Analytics coursework, employing both R and Python programming languages.

The first project revolves around Conjoint Analysis, a valuable marketing research technique. In this project, I applied my analytical skills to understand consumer preferences and decision-making processes. Leveraging R and Python, I conducted a thorough analysis to uncover insights that could inform strategic marketing decisions.

The second project centers on Regression Analysis, a critical tool in marketing analytics. Using R and Python, I delved into data analysis to model and interpret relationships between variables. This project allowed me to demonstrate my knowledge of marketing and proficiency in quantitative analysis and provide actionable insights for optimizing marketing strategies.

Additionally, I have undertaken Python projects focused on visualizing Adidas sales data and other related aspects. These projects serve as a testament to my data visualization and manipulation skills, highlighting my ability to translate data into actionable information for informed business decisions.

Feel free to explore my GitHub repository to delve deeper into these projects and witness my capabilities in marketing analytics, data analysis, and data visualization.
