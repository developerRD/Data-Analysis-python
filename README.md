- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rana Demirer.
- I am a Business Analytics Masters student and here I shared how to create a perceptual map for Marketing Analysis with R codes.

First, Let's talk abput what is a perceptual map

A perceptual map is a chart that shows the perceptions of customers or potential customers. 
In this project, I worked with a dataset that has the brand names and values in the table representing the ratings or scores given to each attribute for each individual.

Data and codes are added here.
